# Matchify prototype

We have implemented the following features in our prototype (detailed in the user stories): 

#### (1) Choosing Filters
#### (2) Selecting Playlist Size
#### (3) Fetching data from firebase realtime database based on the selected filters
#### (4) Swiping Left or Right to choose songs

#### Some notes: 
- The swiping feature is not working 100% well on the emulator but it works perfectly if you use a real smartphone (when you try to swipe you must do it on the album image)
- The code displayed is not yet properly formatted so some screens might have some display bugs
